# Issues and Todo's

- The application keeps replacing the file on the solid pod instead of updating it
- The application does look for the public type index but does not check if the planned location is occupied.
- No documentation
- The application can not find the public folder by navigating from the VCARD. it just assumes that the public folder will be at {webidStoragePlace}/public
